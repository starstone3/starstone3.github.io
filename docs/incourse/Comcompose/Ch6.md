上面的设备统称为I/O设备，包括存储设备、网络设备和其他外设。

Three characters of I/O:

+ **Behavior**:Input (read once), output (write only, cannot  read) ,or storage (can be reread and usually rewritten)

+ **Partner**:Either a human or a machine is at the other end of the I/O  device, either feeding data on input or reading data on  output.

+ **Data Rate**:The peak rate at which data can be transferred between  the I/O device and the main memory or processor.
